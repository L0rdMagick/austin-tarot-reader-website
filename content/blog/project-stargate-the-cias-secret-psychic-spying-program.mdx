It sounds like the plot of a science fiction movie, but it was real. For over two decades, the U.S. government, through agencies like the CIA and DIA, ran a clandestine program to investigate and utilize psychic phenomena for intelligence purposes. This program, which went by many code names, is most famously known as **Project Stargate**.

## What Was Project Stargate?

Started in 1978 at Fort Meade, Maryland, Project Stargate was the military's effort to see if "remote viewing" could be used as an effective intelligence-gathering tool. Remote viewing is the ability to psychically perceive and describe a distant or unseen target. The program recruited and trained a team of gifted individuals who were tasked with "viewing" locations and events of interest during the Cold War.

## The Mission: Psychic Espionage

The objectives of Project Stargate were ambitious and diverse. Remote viewers were asked to:

- Describe the layout of secret Soviet military bases and nuclear facilities.
- Locate downed spy planes and missing submarines.
- Track the whereabouts of hostages and fugitives.
- Predict future political and military events.

While the program had its share of misses, there were also documented "hits" that reportedly astonished intelligence officials. Viewers provided information that was later verified by satellite imagery or on-the-ground intelligence, proving accurate beyond what could be attributed to chance.

## The Legacy of Project Stargate

The program was officially declassified and terminated in 1995. The official conclusion stated that the program was not a reliable enough source of intelligence to be used for operational missions.

However, the legacy of Project Stargate is complex. It remains one of the most extensive government-funded studies of psychic phenomena in history. It brought the concept of remote viewing into the public consciousness and demonstrated that, under controlled conditions, human intuition could access information that seemed impossible to obtain.

The existence of Project Stargate validates a fundamental truth: psychic skills are real and perceivable. While most of us won't be spying for the government, we can all learn to develop our own intuitive abilities.
