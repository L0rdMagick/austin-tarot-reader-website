Tarot is more than just a tool for answering big questions; it's a powerful ally for daily self-care. This simple, 10-minute weekly ritual can help you ground your energy, connect with your intuition, and set a clear intention for the week ahead.

## Your Weekly Tarot Check-In

Set aside a few quiet moments every Sunday evening or Monday morning. Light a candle, take a few deep breaths, and shuffle your tarot deck while thinking about the coming week.

## The Three-Card Spread

When you feel ready, pull three cards and lay them out in front of you.
1.  **Card 1: What energy am I leaving behind from last week?** This card helps you acknowledge and release any lingering stress, challenges, or accomplishments.
2.  **Card 2: What is the main theme or lesson for the week ahead?** This is your focus point. It might be a call for rest (The Hermit), creativity (Ace of Wands), or emotional clarity (Queen of Cups).
3.  **Card 3: What advice does my intuition have for me?** This card offers actionable guidance on how to best navigate the week's theme.

## Integrating the Wisdom

Spend a few moments journaling about the cards. What feelings or insights come up? Write down the main message on a sticky note and place it somewhere you'll see it throughout the week. This ritual is a beautiful act of self-love and a way to build a deeper relationship with your own inner wisdom. While this practice is for self-guidance, a professional reading can explore these themes more deeply. A card like [The Lovers](/blog/the-lovers-card-meaning) in this spread, for example, could signal a week focused on relationships and choices.
