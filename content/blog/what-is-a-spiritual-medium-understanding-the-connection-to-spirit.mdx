The terms "psychic" and "medium" are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct, though related, abilities. While a psychic tunes into the energy of a person or object, a spiritual medium acts as a bridge, facilitating communication between the living and those who have passed into the spirit world.

## What is Mediumship?

Mediumship is the practice of mediating communication between spirits of the dead and living human beings. A spiritual medium fine-tunes their psychic senses to perceive and relay messages from the afterlife. The goal of this practice is often to provide evidence of survival—proof that our consciousness and love continue after physical death—and to bring healing, closure, and comfort to those who are grieving.

## Psychic vs. Medium: What's the Difference?

This is a key distinction. Think of it this way: **all mediums are psychic, but not all psychics are mediums.**

- **A Psychic** perceives information by tapping into your energy field or aura. They can offer insights into your past, present, and potential future, helping you understand your life path. This is the primary focus of my work in tarot and [intuitive coaching sessions](/services).

- **A Spiritual Medium** has the specific ability to connect with and communicate with spirits who are no longer in the physical world. They act as the "middleman," relaying specific messages, memories, and evidence from your loved ones.

While a psychic reading focuses on your life and energy, a mediumship reading is centered on connecting you with the spirit world.

## How Do Mediums Connect with Spirit?

A medium raises their own energetic vibration while spirit communicators lower theirs, allowing them to meet in the middle and establish a connection. They receive information through the same intuitive senses that psychics use, but the source is different:

- **Clairvoyance (Clear Seeing):** Seeing spirits, symbols, or scenes in their mind's eye.
- **Clairaudience (Clear Hearing):** Hearing names, messages, or sounds from spirit.
- **Clairsentience (Clear Feeling):** Feeling the emotions or physical sensations of a spirit, providing a powerful form of evidence.

These are the same senses we explore in our guide to [Clairvoyance and Clairaudience](/blog/clairvoyance-and-clairaudience-tuning-into-your-psychic-senses). A reading with a gifted spiritual medium can be a profoundly healing experience, offering reassurance that our bonds of love are never truly broken.
