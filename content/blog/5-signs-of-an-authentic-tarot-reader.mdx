In a world full of spiritual practitioners, it's vital to know how to tell if a tarot reader is a good, authentic guide. An ethical reading should leave you feeling empowered and clear, not fearful or dependent. Here are five signs you're working with a true professional, and how to spot a potential scam.

## 1. They Empower, They Don't Dictate

An authentic reader understands that the future is not set in stone. They use the cards to show you potential paths and energies, empowering *you* to make the final choice. A scammer will often use fear tactics, predicting unavoidable doom that only they can help you fixâ€”for a price.

## 2. They Create a Safe, Non-Judgmental Space

A reading is a sacred and vulnerable experience. A good reader will be compassionate and professional, holding space for whatever comes up without judgment. If you ever feel shamed, belittled, or pressured, that is a major red flag.

## 3. Their Pricing is Clear and Upfront

Legitimate tarot readers have clear, transparent pricing listed on their website. Beware of anyone who is vague about costs and then pressures you into buying expensive "curse removals" or "spell packages" during a reading.

## 4. They Focus on Your Path, Not Mind-Reading Others

Ethical tarot is a tool for self-insight. While a reading can explore the dynamics of a relationship, its primary focus is *your* energy and *your* journey. A reader who claims to know exactly what someone else is thinking or doing is overstepping ethical boundaries.

## 5. They Don't Create Dependency

A great reader's goal is to help you connect with your *own* intuition. They want you to leave the session feeling more self-reliant. A scammer, by contrast, will try to make you feel dependent on them for every decision, encouraging you to come back again and again for simple answers.
